            At the Microsoft Learn Student Chapter, we believe that young people
            with the right technology have the potential to revolutionise the
            world as we know it today. And through several events held over the
            years, we have made fair progress. Microsoft Learn Student Chapter
            was institutionalised to provide students with a systematic platform
            to develop technical skills and team spirit. Our vision is to create
            a community of computer enthusiasts with a development spirit.
